        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-7 columns">
            <p>I am a web developer, music fan, beer aficionado and Mario Kart champion.  Welcome to my website.  As a recent graduate of MakerSquare (an intensive, full-time web development bootcamp), I am excited and ready to work on projects as a junior developer.</p>
            <p>I have experience building applications using HTML/CSS, Javascript and Ruby on Rails.  Although Ruby is my true love when it comes to coding, I have recently started learning and working with the AngularJS framework and I am very excited about the possibilities.</p>
            <p>I am currently a co-founder and contributor to OkGamer. OkGamer is an application that I started as a student at MakerSquare.  The goal of OkGamer is to improve the quality of interactions in online multiplayer video games by matching players with other people who have similar gaming interests and styles.</p>
